  ## [Description](#table-of-contents)
  In today's age we all use the internet for many things and one of those has become dating. With many options to chose from we have decided to put a spin on the usual dating app. Green Light doesn't allow you to fill out your own profile. You have to send a link to some of your verified  friends on social media (Choose Wisely!) who will in return answer prompts and either pick from your social media posts for images or upload some original embarassing photos from your past to generate your profile. After completion you can scroll through other profiles in your area and either give them the Green Light or Red light!
